# Room-Occupancy-Detection
Room occupancy classification (ROC) is a type of time series classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on a sequence of time series data, such as temperature and humidity. 


Room occupancy classification (ROC) is a type of time series classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a room is
occupied or not based on a sequence of time series data, such as temperature and humidity. ROC is a common problem in smart
buildings, where it can be used to control various systems, such as the HVAC system, lighting system, and security system.

Room occupancy detection is important for a number of reasons, including:

Energy efficiency: By detecting when a room is unoccupied, heating, cooling, and lighting systems can be turned off or adjusted to save energy. This can lead to significant cost savings, particularly in large commercial buildings.
Comfort: Room occupancy detection can be used to ensure that rooms are maintained at a comfortable temperature and light level, even when they are unoccupied. This can improve the comfort and productivity of occupants.
Security: Room occupancy detection can be used to detect unauthorized entry into a room or building. This can help to improve security and reduce the risk of crime.

Random forest classifiers can be used to detect room occupancy by learning from a dataset of sensor data, such as temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels. The classifier can then be used to predict whether a room is occupied or not, based on the current sensor readings.

Random forest classifiers are a good choice for room occupancy detection because they are accurate, robust and interpretable.Room occupancy classification (ROC) is a type of time series classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on a sequence of time series data, such as temperature and humidity.
